Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 
The company would like to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

# Tools
The following python libraries were used for this project:

  Pandas: for data analization

  Seaborn: for data visualization

  Matplotlib: for data visualization

  Numpy: for mathematical equations

  SciPy: for mathematical equations
  # Folders
The project files are divided into different folders:

Project Management: project brief.

Scripts: the notebooks containing the coding for the project.

Analysis: the visualizations made throughtout the project.

Sent to Client: the final report presented in excel.
